# RISCV Multi-cycle CPU implementation

This is the top level for the project documentation. It is broken into three
main sections:

## [Architecture](./arch/arch.html)

Describes the instruction set the core implements.
- Instruction set architecture documentation.
- Privilidged resource architecture documentation.
- Notes on implementation specific details.


## [Micro-Architecture](./uarch/uarch.html)

Describes the implementation details of the core.
- Module hierarchy.
- Interface descriptions.

## [Flow](./flow/flow.html)

Describes how to build, simulate and synthesise the core.
- Makefile documentation.
- EDA tools.
- Simulation steps & testbench information.
- Synthesis steps.
